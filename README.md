# Flutter Chat Composer
>how about transforming your state machine in a chat bot? flutter chat composer makes use of state machines generated by <a href="https://github.com/FelipeMarra/state-composer">state_composer<a> to create chatbots based on those states
# Usage
## Creating the chat's state machine
A chat bot is composed of states
``` dart 
ChatBot(
    id: "myChatBot",
    initialStateId: "A",
    states: [
    _stateA(),
    _stateB(),
    _stateC(),
    _stateD(),
    _stateE(),
    ],
);
```
Each state can be of open or closed text. A closed text one will take transitions with predefined
messages to be displayed. A open text one have a function that comes with the text field's controller that will be used to decide the next state
### Open Text Example
´´´ dart 
  BotState _stateA() {
    return BotStateOpenText(
      id: "A",
      messages: [
        Message(
          texts: [
            const Text("Wellcome to "),
            const Text(
              "State A.",
              style: TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
            ),
          ],
        ),
        Message(
          texts: [
            const Text("Tell me, what do you think about this state?"),
          ],
        ),
      ],
      transitions: [
        BotTransition(
          id: "A=>B",
          to: "B",
        ),
        BotTransition(
          id: "A=>C",
          to: "C",
        ),
      ],
      decideTransition: (textController) {
        if (textController.text.isNotEmpty) {
          return "B";
        } else {
          return "C";
        }
      },
      onEnter: (machine) {
        print("Entered ${machine.currentState!.id}");
      },
      onLeave: (machine, nextState) {
        print("Left ${machine.currentState!.id} going to ${nextState.id}");
      },
    );
  }
´´´
### Closed Text Example
´´´dart 
  BotState _stateB() {
    return BotState(
      id: "B",
      messages: [
        Message(
          texts: [
            const Text("Ok, so now you're in "),
            const Text(
              "State B!",
              style: TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
            ),
          ],
        ),
        Message(texts: [const Text("Where do you wanna go next?")])
      ],
      transitions: [
        BotTransition(
          id: "B=>D",
          to: "D",
          message: Message(texts: [
            const Text("Go from B to D"),
          ]),
        ),
        BotTransition(
          id: "B=>E",
          to: "E",
          message: Message(
            texts: [
              const Text("Go from B to E"),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ],
      onEnter: (machine) {
        print("Entered ${machine.currentState!.id}");
      },
    );
  }
´´´
## Creating the UI
UI is created using the `ChatBotWidget`, just enter the widgets that will be used to display
each part of the state machine.

´´´dart 
    ChatBotWidget(
        ///Widget that displays the [Message]s of the bot, see each group of messages ass a paragraph
        botMessageWidget: _botMessageWidget,
        ///Widget that displays the [Message] of each transition option
        botTransitionWidget: _botTransitionWidget,
        ///Widget that displays the [Message] related to the transition choosen by the user
        userMessageWidget: _userMessageWidget,
        ///Widget that captures the text the user typed when the state type is [BotStateOpenText]
        userOpenTextWidget: _userOpenTextWidget,
        ///SizedBox hight between messages of the same user
        sameUserSpacing: 1,
        ///SizedBox hight betweewn messagen of different users
        difUsersSpacing: 10,
        ///The [ChatBot] that will generate the chat
        chatBot: MyChatBot().chatBot,
    ),
